# MATH20

Math 20- Calculus (3 units) covers properties and applications of integration, including the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and computations of volumes, areas, and arc length of parametric curves. An introduction to some basic notions related to differential equations (such as exponential growth/decay and separable equations) is also given.
